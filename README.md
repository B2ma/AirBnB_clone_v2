#0x00.AirBnB clone - The console

The goal of the project is to deploy on my server a simple copy of the AirBnB website.

The storage system used for this project is a file. But as we advance mySQL will be used as the database storage system.


##The command interpreter

We were tasked to create our own console. It will be used to manage the AirBnB objects.


##How to start the console

To start the console, use the following command:

```
./console.py
```

The prompt ***(hbnb)*** will be displayed on your terminal and you can then enter your command


##How to use the console

To use the console, enter the commands and the appropriate arguments. To get the various command that are available, type in your terminal , help. To get the documentation on how to use a command type, ***help followed by the command***.
